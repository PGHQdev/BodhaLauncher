# Bodha

Intentional Android launcher. This glossary is the ubiquitous language for product and code; decisions behind these terms live in `docs/adr/`.

## Language

**Session**:
The span from device unlock to the device going non-interactive (screen off; always-on display counts as off). A re-unlock within the merge window resumes the same session.
_Avoid_: usage session, screen session, visit

**Peek**:
A screen-on that ends without an unlock — checking the lock screen or glancing at notifications. Not a session.
_Avoid_: pickup (Awareness may count raw unlocks separately; a peek is not one)

**Merge window**:
The 30 seconds after screen-off during which a re-unlock resumes the previous session instead of starting a new one.
_Avoid_: grace period, debounce
